# ALGT - Abstract Language Generation Tool

A tool to create, based on syntax, an interpreter for any language (and support to edit this syntax automatically)

Get started by grabbing the latest [binary](binaries) and by reading the [manual](/src/Assets/Manual/Output/Manual-all.md)

As this is built with stack, building from source should be easy just as well! Run ./build.sh after cloning.
