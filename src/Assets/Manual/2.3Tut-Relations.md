 Relations and Rules: building the evaluator
---------------------------------------------

While we could build an function which evaluates our programming languages, language designers love _natural deduction_ more. Don't worry if you never heard about that before, we'll explain it right away!

### Declaring a relation

First, we declare a new section inside our _STFL.language_, with a relation declaration inside:

$$STFL.language![60..63]!file

Let's break this line down.

The first part, `(→)`, says that we declare a relation with name `→`. Except from some builtin symbols, you can use whatever string you want, including unicode[^unicodeArrow]. If you don't want to use the unicode-arrow for this tutorial, you can replace `→` by `->`.

The second part, `: expr (in), expr (out)` states that this is a relation between two `expr`. As example, `2 + 3` , `5` will be in `(→)` or written more conventionally `2 + 3 →` `5`.

What about the `(in)` and `(out)` parts? These are to help the computer. Given `2 + 3`, it's pretty easy for the computer to calculate `5`. Given `5`, the computer can't magically deduce that this was computed by calculating `2 + 3`, especially because an infinite amount of possible calculations might lead to the result `5`.
We call this the *mode* of the argument.

The last part, `Pronounced as "evaluation"` defines a name for the relation. It's just an extra, to help users of your language to know what a relation is supposed to do or to help them searching it on a search engine.

[^unicodeArrow]: to enter an unicode character on a linux machine, type `Left-Ctrl + Shift + U`, release, and type the hexcode of the desired character, e.g. `2192` to get the right-arrow
