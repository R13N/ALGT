\section{What is ALGT?}\label{what-is-algt}

\emph{ALGT}, of \emph{Automated Language Generation Tool} \footnote{Note
  the similarity of \emph{ALGT} and \emph{AGT} . The tool started it's
  life as \emph{AGT}, based on the paper \emph{Abstracting Gradual
  Typing}. When it became more general, another name and acronym was
  used. TODO reference to paper!} is a tool to formally specify any
programming language. This is done by first declaring a syntax, using
BNF, and then declaring semantics by introducing logical deduction
rules, such as evaluation or typing rules. Eventually, properties can be
introduced which can be tested. Of course, these can be run.

The tool is kept as general as possible, so any language can be
modelled.
