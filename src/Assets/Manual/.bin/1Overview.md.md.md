 What is ALGT?
===============

_ALGT_, of _Automated Language Generation Tool_ [^AGT-Name] is a tool to formally specify any programming language. This is done by first declaring a syntax, using BNF, and then declaring semantics by introducing logical deduction rules, such as evaluation or typing rules.  Eventually, properties can be introduced which can be tested. Of course, these can be run.

The tool is kept as general as possible, so any language can be modelled.


[^AGT-Name]: Note the similarity of _ALGT_ and _AGT_ . The tool started it's life as _AGT_, based on the paper _Abstracting Gradual Typing_. When it became more general, another name and acronym was used. TODO reference to paper!
