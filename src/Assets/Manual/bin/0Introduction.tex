\section{ALGT}\label{algt}

This document gives an overview of the \emph{ALGT}-tool. First, a
general overview of what the tool does is given and why it was
developped. Second, a hands-on tutorial develops a simply typed lambda
calculus. Thirdly, the reference manual gives an in-depth table of what
options and flags can be used. Fourth, some concepts and algorithms are
explained more thoroughly, together with properties they use. And as
last, the `dynamize' and `gradualize' options are explained in depth, as
these are what the master disertation is about.
