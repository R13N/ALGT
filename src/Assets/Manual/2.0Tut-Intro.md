 Tutorial: developing a simple programming language
====================================================

We will develop a programming language which can work with booleans and integers. Apart from doing basic arithmetic, we can use anonymous functions.

Example programs are:

$$examples.stfl!file



The expression `(\x : Int . x + 1)` is a _lambda expression_. This is an anonymous function, taking one argument - named x- of type `Int`. When applied (e.g. `(\x : Int . x + 1) 41`, the expression right of the `.` is returned, with the variable `x` substituted by the argument, becoming `41 + 1`.


 Setting up a .language
------------------------

A language is declared inside a `.language` file [^extension]. Create `STFL.language`, and put a title in it:

[^extension]: Actually, the extension doesn't matter at all.


$$STFLBool.language![1..6]!file


You can put comments wherever you want after a `#`, e.g. to give some explanation about the language
