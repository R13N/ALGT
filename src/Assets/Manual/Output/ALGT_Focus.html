<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>The last fundamental part of our language are it's properties.</p>
<p>Arbitrary properties can be stated just as rules can.</p>
<p>ALGT will check that these properties hold, by trying a bunch of random examples, effectively quickchecking your language implementation.</p>
<p>Most languages are concerned about two properties: <em>preservation</em> and <em>progress</em>.</p>
<h3 id="stating-preservation">Stating Preservation</h3>
<p><em>Preservation</em> is the property that, when an expression <code>e0</code> of type <code>T</code> is evaluated, the new expression <code>e1</code> is still of type <code>T</code>. Without this property, our typechecker would be useless...</p>
<p>Now, we can state this property in the <code>Properties</code>-section of the file:</p>
TODO lines

<p>As our implementation is correct, we can just run our program as following, and see it did try to proof us wrong:</p>
TODO

<p>We can ask ALGT to try more examples, with the <code>--quickcheck-runs NUMBER-OF-RUNS</code> flag:</p>
TODO

<p>Pfew, luckily we didn't find a counter example.</p>
<h3 id="stating-progress">Stating progress</h3>
<p>Another important property is <em>progress</em>. It states that, if an expression is well-typed, we can either in canonical form (a simple value, the result of our calculation).</p>
<h3 id="testing-examples-from-a-file-against-a-property">Testing examples from a file against a property</h3>
<h3 id="disabling-quickchecks-and-symbolic-checks">Disabling quickchecks and symbolic checks</h3>
<p>If the quickchecks take to long, you can disable them, using <code>--quickcheck-runs 0</code>. When the other checks takes to long (liveability and totality), add <code>--no-check</code> to disable them all.</p>
